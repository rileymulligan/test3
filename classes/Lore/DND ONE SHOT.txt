Magical school
	Students are split into differing groups (think houses from hogwarts)

The school has a �survival rate� (Public thinks its natural for a magic school, in reality the deaths are being used for some other purpose)

	
	
Conflict:
A group of students/faculty try to absorb more power for some end goal (think eel pool from Witcher)
	
	This group has to fully kill students (0 hp) + they have artifact to suck their magic out

	They are sucking this magic | god to cross into mortal realm |
